# 32-bit Pipelined RISC-V CPU

This document describes the v0.1 CPU project - `cpu-v0_1.vcb`.

## Specs

* RISC-V 32-bit integer ISA (RV32I)
* 5 stage pipeline (with register RAW- & control hazard halts)
* 15-tick clock
* 32 registers
* VMEM for instruction & data memory

## Goals

* Compile C code to .vcbmem (for ease of programming)
* Use pipelining (to learn more about it)
* Clarity/documentation in the VCB project
* Avoid using tunnels, meshes & wireless inks
* Low clock period in ticks
* Use chip-based design with decoration layer (like VICP)
* Compact design

## Limitations

* The CPU hasn't been extensively tested.
  So there could be un-discovered bugs. 
* Memory only works for word-aligned access.
  * gcc compiler flag `-mstrict-align` enforces this.
* `lb`/`lbu` (load byte) doesn't work
* `lh`/`lhu` (load half-word) doesn't work
* `ecall` doesn't do anything
* `ebreak` doesn't do anything
* Exceptions/traps aren't raised
* Instruction fetches don't halt for stores in the pipeline.
  * If you modify programs 2 instructions from PC, the CPU will execute the old instruction. (Very unlikely to happen in practice.)

## Planned improvements

* [x] Use faster adder for ALU
* [ ] Add Virtual Display
* [ ] Write display driver for Virtual Display
* [ ] Add data forwarding to avoid RAW hazard halts
* [ ] Speed up clock (in ticks)
* [ ] Use a more compact PC incrementor
* [ ] Add support for byte & half-word loads
* [ ] Handle VMEM RAW hazards for instruction fetches

(Leaving out multiplication, division & floating point math for now. Perhaps something for the next version.)

## Technical Details

### Multiplexers

* PC-SRC
  * 1: j-target
  * 0: PC+4
* ALU-I2-SRC
  * 11: EX-OUT-DATA
  * 10: WRITE-DATA
  * 01: imm
  * 00: r2
* ALU-I1-SRC
  * 11: EX-OUT-DATA
  * 10: WRITE-DATA

  * 01: imm
  * 00: alu-out
* MEM-OUT-SRC
  * 1: load-data
  * 0: ex-out-data

### Pipeline

The CPU pipeline consists of 5 stages:
* IF: Instruction Fetch
* ID: Instruction Decode
* EX: Execute
* MEM: Memory
* WB: Write Back

#### RAW Hazard Controller

##### Inputs

Input signals:
* I1
  * RS1==PC-1-RD -> Previous instruction 'may write to RS1'
  * PC-2-WRITE-RS-1 = (RS1==PC-2-RD && PC-2-REG-WRITE) -> Second before instruction 'writes to RS1'
* I2
  * ALU-I2-IMM -> I2 'is an immediate value'
  * RS2==PC-1-RD -> Previous instruction 'may write to RS2'
  * PC-2-WRITE-RS-2 = (RS2==PC-2-RD && PC-2-REG-WRITE) -> Second before instruction 'writes to RS2'
* Both
  * PC-1-REG-WRITE -> Previous instruction 'writes to register file'
  * PC-1-MEM-LOAD -> Previous instruction 'loads from memory'
* *PC-2-MEM-LOAD is irrelevant -> the value is already in the MEM pipeline register*

Assumptions for inputs:
```
if (PC-1-MEM-LOAD) {
  assert (PC-1-REG-WRITE);
}
```

##### Outputs

Hazard control signals:
* I1, one of:
  * I1-EX-STALL
  * ALU-I1-SRC-PC-1
  * ALU-I1-SRC-PC-2
  * ALU-I1-SRC-r1
* I2, one of:
  * I2-EX-STALL
  * ALU-I2-SRC-PC-1
  * ALU-I2-SRC-PC-2
  * ALU-I2-SRC-imm
  * ALU-I2-SRC-r2
* EX-STALL = (I1-EX-STALL || I2-EX-STALL), sets all of:
  * IF-STALL
  * ID-STALL
  * EX-STALL
  * MEM-FLUSH

##### Logic

I1 logic:
```
if (RS1==PC-1-RD) { // Previous instruction 'may write to RS1'
  if (PC-1-REG-WRITE) { // Previous instruction 'writes to RS1'
    if (PC-1-MEM-LOAD) { // Previous instruction 'loads from memory' -> stall, not available yet
      set UNTIL-EX-STALL;
    } else { // Previous instruction 'calculates in EX stage' -> get I1 from MEM pipeline register
      set ALU-I1-SRC-PC-1;
    }
  }
  if (RS1==PC-2-RD && PC-2-REG-WRITE) { // Second before instruction 'writes to RS1' -> get I1 from MEM pipeline register
    set ALU-I1-SRC-PC-2;
  } else { // Second before instruction 'doesn't write to RS1' -> get I1 from register file
    set ALU-I1-SRC-r1;
  }
} else { // Previous instruction 'doesn't write to RS1''
  if (RS1==PC-2-RD && PC-2-REG-WRITE) { // Second before instruction 'writes to RS1' -> get I1 from MEM pipeline register
    set ALU-I1-SRC-PC-2;
  } else { // Second before instruction 'doesn't write to RS1' -> get I1 from register file
    set ALU-I1-SRC-r1;
  }
}
```

I2 logic:
```
if (ALU-I2-IMM) { // I2 'is an immediate value' -> get I2 from immediate value
  set ALU-I2-SRC-imm;
} else { // I2 'is not an immediate value'
  (same as I1)
}
```
